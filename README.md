# In-Memory File System <br>
A console-based in-memory file system built using core Data Structures like Tree, Trie, HashMap and Algorithms like String Parsing, Recursion, DFS. <br>
Simulates Unix-like file operations such as `mkdir`, `cd`, `ls`, `touch`, etc. **Without using the actual file system**.<br><br>

## Problem Statement <br>
Design and implement a file system that: <br>
- Maintains a virtual folder/file structure in memory. <br>
- Allows users to create, delete, and navigate directories. <br>
- Stores file metadata and simulates basic content handling. <br>
- Lookup and Traversal should be fast. <br>
- Allows Unix-Like file operations such as `mkdir`, `cd`, `cat`, `echo`. <br>
- Built using OOP principle. <br><br>
